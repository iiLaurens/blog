Sometimes you would like to run a process continously. It should run always, even after a failing. We require a supervisor that monitors a process and starts or restarts it whenever needed. This is why *Supervisord* exists.

I will be running supevisor on my Raspberry pi.

# Installation and configuration
To intall supervisor, just run the following command
`sudo apt-get install -y supervisor`
To start supervisor after installing it, run it as a service with
`sudo service supervisor start`

Configuration for Supervisord is found in `/etc/supervisor`. If we look at the configuration file `/etc/supervisord/supervisord.conf`, we'll see at the following at the bottom:
```Bash
[include]
files = /etc/supervisor/conf.d/*.conf
```

So, any files found in /etc/supervisor/conf.d and ending in .conf will be included. This is where we can add configurations for our services.
Now we need to tell Supervisord how to run and monitor our Node script. What we'll do is create a configuration that tells Supervisord how to start and monitor the Node script.
